    raised in a C function 

2003.11.08:
    Cleanup
    UNIX related stuff exchanged with OS independent functions
    fprintf -> chan_std_err,chan_std_out
    Raw Amoeba split

2003.11.20:
    Backtracing again fixed:
    Debug and event Positions now reduced to 24 Bit (&0xFFFFFFF)
    Fuzzy logic in exception raised from C function extended (+-8 Bytes
    to nearest closure)

2004.8.26:
    added backtrace verbose mode (prints outs debugging infos)
    CAMLRUNPARAM=d

2004.12.25:
    changed event lookup: if there is no matching event found, a search
    window is used to find a closure nearest to event location.

2005.1.5:
    some minor changes 
    added init_debuginfo ()
    changed event_for_location: searches now always with increased PC window
    if there is no event exactly mathing the given PC value (nonetheless the value
    of exc_ccall_pc!!!)
    needed for debugging...
