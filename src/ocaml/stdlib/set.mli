(** Sets over ordered types.

   This module implements the set data structure, given a total ordering
   function over the set elements. All operations over sets
   are purely applicative (no side-effects).
   The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and is therefore
   reasonably efficient: insertion and membership take time
   logarithmic in the size of the set, for instance.

    val compare : t -> t -> int
      (** A total ordering function over the set elements.
          This is a two-argument function [f] such that
          [f e1 e2] is zero if the elements [e1] and [e2] are equal,
          [f e1 e2] is strictly negative if [e1] is smaller than [e2],
          and [f e1 e2] is strictly positive if [e1] is greater than [e2].
          Example: a suitable ordering function is
          the generic structural comparison function {!Pervasives.compare}. *)
